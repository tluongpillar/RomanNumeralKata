## Roman Numeral rules:
- Roman numerals consist of the following letters: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M which mean one, five, ten, fifty, hundred, five hundred and one thousand respectively.
- An example would be "XIV" + "LX" = "LXXIV"
- Numerals can be concatenated to form a larger numeral ("XX" + "II" = "XXII").
- If a lesser numeral is put before a bigger it means subtraction of the lesser from the bigger ("IV" means four, "CM" means ninehundred).
- If the numeral is I, X or C you can't have more than three ("II" + "II" = "IV" not “IIII”).
- If the numeral is V, L or D you can't have more than one ("D" + "D" = "M" not “DD”)
- The maximum roman numeral is 3999 (MMMCMXCIX)
